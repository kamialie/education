Docker Engine and Docker Machine
    > Docker Engine - client-servier application made up of the Docker daemon,
        a REST API (specifies interfaces for interacting with daemon), and
        CLI client that talks to the daemon (through the REST API wrapper).
        Accepts docker commands like docker run <image>, docker ps...
    > Docker Machine - tool for provisioning and managing Dockerized hosts
        (hosts with Docker Engine on them). Has its own command line client
        docker-machine and the Docker Engine client, docker. Can use Machine to
        install Docker Engine on ome or more virtual systems. Virtual hosts can
        be local (for example VirtualBox) or remote (Dockerized hosts on cloud
        providers). Dockerized hosts are referred as "machines".
