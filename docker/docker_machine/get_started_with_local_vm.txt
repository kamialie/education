Prerequisite info
    > Docker Desktop comes with docker-machine
    > new solutions(Desktop versions) come with their own native virtualization
        solutions rather than Oracle VirtualBox - you can use
        'docker-machine create' with the vurtualbox driver to create additional
        local machines (Mac version uses HyperKit)

Use Machine to run Docker containers
    > to run Docker container you need:
        - create a new (or start an existing) Docker virtual machine
        - switch your environment to your new VM
        - use the docker client to create, load, and manage containers
    > machine maintains its configs between uses just like VMs

Create a machine
    - open shell
    - run 'docker-machine ls' - should output nothing, as there is not machines
        yet
    - run 'docker-machine create --driver virtualbox <name>'
