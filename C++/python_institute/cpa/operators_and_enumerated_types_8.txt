Overloading operators - basics
    > classification:
        - unary, binary, ternary
        - prefix, postfix, infix
    > in C++ it is possible to overload existing operators (can create new), but
        cant redifine existing meaning
    > operator function may be implemented as:
        - method of a class - implicitly assumed that an object of that class is
            one of the required operator's arguments
        - "standalone" - function must explicitly specify the types of its
            arguments
    > [return_type] operator[operator] (argument) - operator overloading, first 
        word is a keyword, second is one of existing operators is C++(must be 
        glued together); stack push method as operator example:
            void Stack::operator<< (int v) throw (stack_overflow) - should be
                able to throw the same type of exception as the method it uses
                inside
    > to make a chained call possible (like values passed to cout) return the
        reference to the object; in stack example it is:
            Stack& operator>> (int v) throw(stack_overflow);
    > to make same stuff as above without touching source code of the class,
        add a standalone operator definition my specifying a reference to an
        object of the class as the first argument

Enumerated types
    > declaration:
        enum weekday {SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY...} - name of enumerator is weekday,
            compiler assigned values from 0 to 6 (also implicitly promoted to int,
            when used in context requiring integral values - '+', '-' operators)
    > in order to assign a value to variable of type enum you need to cast by
        one of the following ways(data will be lost):
            weekday day = static_cast<weekday>(0);
            weekday day = (weekday)0;
    > to assign custom values add equal sign followed by a value, need to specify
        first two - the following will be assumed:
            enum Symbols {ALPHA = -1, BETA = 1, GAMMA};
