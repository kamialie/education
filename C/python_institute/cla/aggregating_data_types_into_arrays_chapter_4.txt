Switch
    > example:
        switch(expression)
        {
            case condition_1:
            {
                //statement;
                break;
            }
            case condition_2:
            {
                //statement;
                break;
            }
            default:
            {
                //statement;
            }
        }
    > remarks - the value after the case must not be an expression containing
        variables or any other entities whose values aren't known at compilation
        time; case branches are scanned in the same order in which they are
        specified

Vectors (arrays)
    > also called vector:
        int numbers[5];
    > any expression can be the index too

Sorting data
    > bubble sort wit do-while loop

Initiators
    > examples:
        int vector[5] = {0,1,2,3,4};
        int vector[5] = {0,1}; - rest initialized to '0'
        int vector[] = {0,1,2,3,4}; - can ommit size, size will be assumed to
            equal number of elements

Pointers
    > null pointer - p = 0; (agreed to use NULL instead)
    > sizeof operator - highest possible priority, arguments can be literals,
        variables, expressions, ro types(only operator to accept type); may not
        use parenthesis when argument is literal or value, but must use if it
        is a type

Pointers vs. arrays
    > pointer arithmetics - multiplied by type size...

Strings
    > 

Assigning values to string
    > not allowed:
        char str[20];
        str = "some string";
        
Processing strings
    > #include <string.h>

Bonus
    > if switch branch doesnt have a break, it falls to the next one without
        checking
    > for loop post increment AND pre increment happen after its body execution
    > pay attenstion what is used - strcat or scrcpy!
