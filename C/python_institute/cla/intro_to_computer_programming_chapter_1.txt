First program
    > puts("some string") - outputs a string with a trailing new line to stdout
    > changes the preprocessir introduces are controlled entirely by its
        directives (include directive - #include smth.h)

Integer values, integer variables and comments
    > 0(zero) preceded in number means its octal, 0x - hexadecimal
    > keywords - auto, break, case, char, complex, const, continue, default, do,
        double, else, enum, extern, float, for, goto, if, imaginary, inline,
        int, long, register, restrict, return, short, signed, sizeof, static,
        struct, switch, typedef, union, unsigned, void, volatile, while
    > from complilers standpoint any comments is only one space (/* */)

bonus:
    >
        double x = -.1;
        int i = x;
        i WILL BE 0
    
    >
        int i = 0, j = 1, k;
        k = i << i + j << i;
        k WILL BE 0 (higher precedence of + operator)
