General info about DevOps
    > DevOps conveyor is sequential stages where assembly or distribution go through
        multiple quality gates (quality check to predict errors on late stges of
        development)
    > object going through uniform DevOps conveyor is automated system as a whole
        ot its part (configuration element for example)
    > main instument - jenkins

Main stages of DevOps conveyor
    > Continuous integration (CI) - software development practice, frequent automated
        assemblies for early error detections; is done in development and finished
        by creating and posting distribution in repository(Nexus) where it is
        going to be used to CDL
        https://sbtatlas.sigma.sbrf.ru/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=659688929
    > Continuous delivery (CDL) - software development practice that guarantees
        that software is always ready for deployment in production; practice
        includes automated deployment on test environments, automated success
        testing of admin deployment (technical and functional deployment testing),
        passing for testing and functional, load, dynamic security testing;
        before CDL stage Nexus repository already has app instalation package
        (distribution), then it goes unchanged through all tests
        https://sbtatlas.sigma.sbrf.ru/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=659689008
    > Continuous deployment (CDP) - software development practice, automation
        of delivery process from development to production, automation of ПСИ
        and production deployment of automated system
        https://sbtatlas.sigma.sbrf.ru/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=659689082
    > Continuous testing - the main part of DevOps conveyor, where each section
        is connected with quality gates; conveyor's job is determined as executing
        environment development scripts and instalation package, loading and
        executing tests and analising results; other tets are done on separete
        stages:
            CI - module and static testing
            CDL - functional, regression, integration, load and dynamic testing
            CDP - ПСИ
