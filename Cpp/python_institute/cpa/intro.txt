First program
    > example:
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        int main(void)
        {
            cout << "first program";
            return (0);
        }
    > namespace - abstract container created to hold a logical grouping of unique
        entities(blocks); all elements of the standard C++ library are declared
        inside std(have to include outside any function at the top of the file)

Integer values, integer variables and comments
    > for octal number precede with zero - 0123, for hexadecimal precede with
        zero x - 0x123
    > block comments can't be nested

Numbers and their operators
    > 3e10 or 3E10 - scientific notation, exponent must be integer
    > converting from float to int simpty cuts decimal part
    > division by zero return inf (infinitive)???
