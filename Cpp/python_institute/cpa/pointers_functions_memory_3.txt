Pointers
    > pointers are used to store information about the location (address) of any
        other data
    > int *p; - declaring a pointer to data of type int
    > C++ syntax doesnt allow to assign integer literal to pointer (pointer = 1234)
    > p = 0; null pointer (or p = NULL, include cstring header or any other
        which includes it, for example iostream does)
    > p &i; - assign address of a variable
    > i = *p; - dereferencing - operator where the pointer variable becomes
        synanymous with the value it points to
    > sizeof - operator (unary prefix) that provides info on how many bytes of
        memory its argument occupies or may occupy; takes variables, literals
        and types as its argument; may not use parethesis, if argument is a value
        or literal, but have to for types
