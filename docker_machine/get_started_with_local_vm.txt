Prerequisite info
    > Docker Desktop comes with docker-machine
    > new solutions(Desktop versions) come with their own native virtualization
        solutions rather than Oracle VirtualBox - you can use
        'docker-machine create' with the vurtualbox driver to create additional
        local machines (Mac version uses HyperKit)

Use Machine to run Docker containers
    > to run Docker container you need:
        - create a new (or start an existing) Docker virtual machine
        - switch your environment to your new VM
        - use the docker client to create, load, and manage containers
    > machine maintains its configs between uses just like VMs

Create a machine
    - open shell
    - "docker-machine ls" - should output nothing, as there is not machines
        yet
    - "docker-machine create --driver virtualbox <name>" - create a machine
    - "docker-machine env <name>" - tell Docker to talk to the new machine
    - "eval $(docker-machine env <name>)" - connect shell to the new machine;
        sets environment variables for the current shell that the Docker client
        reads whick specify the TLS settings - need to do each time open a new
        shell or restart a machine

Run containers and experiment with Machine
    - docker run - to download and run containers
    - docker run -d -p 8000:80 nginx - run a web server in a container; is available
        on docker-machine ip address on port 8000

Start local machines on startup
    > can put $(docker-machine env default) in shell configuration file, however
        its only going to work if machine is already running
