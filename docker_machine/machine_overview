Difference between Docker Machine and Docker Engine
    > Engine - client-server application made up of the Docker daemon, REST API,
        CLI client that talks to the daemon (through REST API wrapper); accepts
        commands such as docker run <image>, docker ps...
    > Machine - tool for provisioning and managing Dockerized hosts (hosts with
        Docker Engine on them), typically installed on local system, has its own
        command line client (docker-machine) and the Docker Engine client, docker;
        The Dockerized hosts are sometimes reffered to as, managed "machines"
