HTTP
    > built-in support in Python through sockets(almost like files, but two-way
        connection)
    > https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt - http protocol

world's simpliest web browser
    > GET command:
        GET [page requested] [followed by a blank line]
    > server first returns header with info about documents content followed by
        a blank line
    > b'' and encode() are equivalent - store data as a bytes object
        b'hell'
        'hello'.encode()
    > new line in  - '\r\n'
    > f.e. retrieve_text_http.py

retrieving an image over HTTP
    > recv() method - method request data from server, takes max number of bytes
        to recieve
    > server and client have different speeds of sending and recieving data,
        thus call to time.sleep() will create a delay and fill intermediate
        buffer, so that server goes ahead and client can get more data on each
        call
    > f.e. retrieve_img_http.py

retrieving web pages using urllib
    > import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    > f.e.:
        fhand = urllib.request.urlopen('url_example')
    > now can works with fhand just like with file handler

reading binary files using urllib
    > f.e. - read_binary_urllib.py
    > read() method returns source code as bytes object instead of returning
        an HTTPResponse object        

parsing HTML using regular expressions
    > f.e. html_parsing_regex.py
    > ssl library allows program to access web site with strictly HTTPS enforce
