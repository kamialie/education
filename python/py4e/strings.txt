> string slices
    s = 'Monty Python'
    s[0:5] - returns Monty. Ommiting first or last index makes slicing to start
        from the beginning or go till the end. If the first index is greater
        than or equal to the second the result is an empty string
    in operator takes two strings and return True or False if first string
        appears as substring in the second
