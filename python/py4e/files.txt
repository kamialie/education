opening files
    > fhand = open(filename)
    > fails with traceback on fail (f.e. file doesn't exist)

reading files
    > f.e. for line in fhand:
        #do smth
    > line is set of characters separerated with '\n' including it 
    > inp = fhand.read() - inp now contains entire file as one string

writing files
    > fout = open(filename, 'w') - need to open in write mode to be able to
        write to a file (if file existed, it would clear it out)
    > fout.write(str) - write a line to a file; return number of characters
        written (doesnt add new line at the end)
    > fout.close() - close after write (Python automatically closes open file
        when the program ends, thus can skip when just reading)

extra
    > s = '1 2\t 3\n 4'
      rerp(s) - returns string representation of an object (tabs, etc
        represented with backslash)
