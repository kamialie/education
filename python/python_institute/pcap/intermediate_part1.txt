Using modules
    > file with definitions that are used in a scripts or in an interactive
        instance of the interpreter
    > to add module functions, variables, classes, etc into script:
        import module_name
    > to add more either state import smth on the next line, or specify next
        module after comma on the current line
    > nameplace - a space in which some names exist and the names dont conflict
        with each other
    > after import is done, names in that namespace become available, but they
        dont conflict with already existing names
    > access variable from module:
        math.pi
    > import entities precisely(only those specified are imported, can be now
        accessed without qualification, the later overwrites):
            from math import pi
    > alias imported modules name or entity:
       import module as alias 
       from module import name as alias, another_name as another_alias
