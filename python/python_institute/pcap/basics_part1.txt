First program
    > functions:
        - built-in
        - modules
        - yours
    > Keywords - consist of three elements: keyword, equal sign, value;
        keyword arguments have to be put after the last optional argument!
    > print keywords - sep, end

Python literals
    > underscores are allowed to be used in numeric literals
    > 0o or 0O - octal value, 0x or 0X - hexadecimal, should be in front of number
    > can omit zero in front or after the decimal point, if its the only number
    > scientific notation - 3e8 or 3E8 that is 3 * 10^8
        - exponent has to be an integer, base can be an integer
    > can use both single or double quotes for string, but should be consistent

Operators
    > ** - exponentiation
    > if one of arguments is float, result if float
    > result of division operator ('/') is always a float
    > // - integer division (still returns float if one of arguments is a float)
        result is always rounder to the lesser integer
    > if one of arguments of modulo operation is a float, result is float
    > exponentiation has right-to-left priority

Variables
    > any Unicode naming is valid in Python
    > shortcut operator - only += for example

Talk to a computer
    > result of input() function is a string
    > * operator with strings - less or equal to 0 second argument produces
        empty string
