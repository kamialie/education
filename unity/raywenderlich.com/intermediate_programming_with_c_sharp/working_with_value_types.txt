Value types - ints, bool, double, float...

1) Structs
    > example:
        struct City // generally name starts with capital letter
        {
            public string Name; // public key work - anyone can access
            public int Size; // capital case - let anyone know field is public
            public string Location;
        }
        var myCity = new City();
        myCity.Name = "NY" // access field(member, property) of a structure, by default are private
