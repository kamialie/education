a) Choose aspect ration 2 by 3 in layout dropdonw (top right corner)

	1) scene view - where you construct your game

	2) game view - player's perspective of game (can choose specific screen aspect ratio to confirm support by all devices

	3) hierarchy window - list of all current GameObjects. GameObj - empty containers that are customized by you. GameO can contain other GameObjs. Every scene starts with a Main Camera and a Directional Light (both GameObjs as well)

	4) project window - list of all assets used by your game. Can simply drag to the scene. Do not make changes in file system, do it in Project window (metadata can be disrupted)

	5) inspector window - lets you configure any GameObj 

	6) toolbar - manipulate the varius GameObj in scene view:
		- Hand tool(Q) - drag mouse over the Scene to pan entire scene
			> right-click - rotate camera around current possition
			> Ctrl and Alt right-click - zoom in and out
			> right-click then WASD - move like in first-person shooter, QE - up and down (Shift to move faster)
			> double-click in GameObj in hierarchy window to center camera on object
		- Translate tool(W) - select and position a GameObj in the scene. Red arrow - x axis, green - y axis, blue - z axis (Unity coordinate system is left-handed!) are known as gizmo in Unity.
			> press one of the arrows  - move along specific axis
			> press colored plane - move the GameObj in two axis
		- Rotate tool(E) - rotate GameObj
			> click line - rotate along specified axis
			> click in between lines - free rotation
		- Scale tool(R) - scale
			> click colored box - scale along specific axis
			> clock grey box - proportional scale on all axis
		- Rect tool(T) - resize, scale, rotate 2D assets, reset pivot point(primarily used in 2D and UI)
		- Transform tool(Y) - combines transforming, scaling and rotating into one tool
		- Center / Pivot toggle
			> Center - when two objects selected(center gizmo between them is created) rotation is done around the center gizmo
			> Pivot - each object rotates around its own gizmo
		- Global / Local toggle
			> Global - manipulations are from the point of view of the world around it, that is x-axis goes left to right, y-axis goes up and down, z-axis goes forward and backwards
			> Local - works from the coordinate system of the object itself

	7) Play buttons
		- play - starts the game. Any changes made on the fly will be lost (good practice - change the color of Playmode tint in Preferences->Colors)
		- pause - just like in play mode all modifications will be lost, use as a playground for testing
		- step - step through frame by frame

	8) Miscellaneous editor settings
		- collab - cloud for team projects
		- services - add services like in-Game ads, analytics, performance reporting, etc
		- account - Unity account control
		- layers - preventing the rendering of GameObjs, excluding GameObjs from physics events (f.e. collisions)
		- layout - customize your windows
