1) every Gameobj comes with built-in components:
    > Transform - holds position, rotation and scale of Gameobj
    > Box Collider - collider in the shape of cube to detect collisions
    > Mesh filter - mesh data with is used ti show a 3D model

2) create C# script
    > Project window->C# script
    > derived from the base class MonoBehavior
    > most common methods:
        - Start() - will get called once right before script gets its first update
        - Update() - gets fired every frame
        - OnDestroy() - gets called right before Gameobj gets destroyed
        - OnCollisionEnter() - when collider or rigidbody of current Gameobj touches another collider(rigidbody)
        - https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html

3) movement script
    > initialize fields in Start method
    > FixedUpdate() is frame independent and should be used when workig with Rigidbodies. Will be fired at a constant interval
    > loop checks if any of the input keys were pressed
    > if key is pressed:
        get the direction for the pressed key, multiply by acceleration and number of seconds it took to complete the last frame - produces a direction vector
    > general rule when you perform an action on every (fixed) frame, you need to multiply by Time.deltaTime
