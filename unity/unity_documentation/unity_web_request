UnityWebRequest - Normal code flow for any http transaction:
    1) create a web request object
    2) configure the web request object
        > set custom headers
        > set http verb (such as GET, POST, HEAD), allowed in all platforms except android
        > set URL
    3) (optional) create an upload handler and attach it to the web request
        > provide data to be uploaded
        > provide http form to be uploaded
    4) (optional) create a download handler and attach to the web request
    5) send the web request
        > if inside a coroutine, you may yield the result of the send and for the request to complete
    6) (optional) read received data from the download handler
    7) (optional) read error info, http status code and response headers from the UnityWebRequest object
