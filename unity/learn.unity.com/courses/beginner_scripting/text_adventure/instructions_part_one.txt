1) ScriptableObjects (class)
    > not attached to GameObjects
    > can be used to store data or execute code
    > more info: "Overthrowing The MonoBehaviour Tyranny In A Glorious ScriptableObject Revolution" by Richard Fine

2) List
    > represents a stringly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index, provides methods to search, sor, and manipulate lists
    > does not need to ahve a size declared when declared. As new elements are added, list get longer
    > type of list must be specific with <>, example:
        List<Transform> someTransforms = new List<Transform> ();

3) System.Serializable (attribute)
    > lets you embed a class with sub properties in the inspector
    > can use this to display variables in the imspector similar to how a Vector3 shows up in the inspector: the name and a triagnle to expand its properties
    > to do this need to create a class that derives from System.Object and give it the Serializable attribute
    > remove MonoBehaviour class inheritance form the class

4) Dictionary
    > an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in a collection
    > example:
        Dictionary<string, GameObject> myDictionary;
        GameObject player1 = myDictionary["Player 1"];
    > can not be Serializable

5) Inheritance
    > lets you create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior that is defined in other class
    > class whose members are inherited is called base class
    > class that inherits those members is called derived class

6) Abstract modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation
    > use in class declaratin to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class for other classes
    > members marked as abstract, or included in an abstract calss, must be implementated by classes that derive from the abstract class
    > override modifier is requiere to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, property, event, etc.
    > example:

7) Delegation pattern
    > an object handles a request by delegating a second object (the delegate)
    > in TextAdventure we will delagate behavior to ScriptableObject assets called InputActions including 'go, examine, take, use' and 'inventory'
    
8) EvenSystem
    > whenever UI is included EvenSystem object in created - it handles all actions like button, mouse clicks, etc
    > for example Input field is listing to return event
