1) Alt + Cmd key on any tools selected allows to move around (like Q was selected)
2) in flight mode (right mouse-click) WASDQE are used to move around
3) Alt + left-mouse-click - rotate around focus point (under cursor)
4) Alt + right-mouse-click - zoom in/out
5) select object, place cursor in scene view, press f to move and focus on object
6) if object is a children of another parent object in hierarchy , its transform values are relative to the parent object's transform values
    All rotations, transformations, etc are therefore applied to both children and parent objectsi (when parent is modified)
7) 2 column layout on project window sets first column as favourites
8) if added a tag in inspector menu, scripts can access those with
    player = GameObject.FindWithTag("Player);
9) Layers:
    add new layer;
    go to Culling mask field and select layers to be seen
