2) Building a framework
    > needs:
        - FlexibleUIData Scriptable Object - will hold all of the data of UI
            layouts
        - FlexibleUI Base Class - holds abstract methods that scripts will
            extend and controls overarching behaviour of UI system
        - FlexibleUIButton Class - (added to button object) derives from
            FlexibleUI Base Class, used to skin and control the behaviour of
            button
        - FlexibleUIMenu Class - static class that will hold list of all prefabs
            (so that they can be easily accessed and instantiated)
    > FlexibleUI script
        - [ExecuteInEditMode()] - executes script while in edit mode
        - if (Application.isEditor) - checks if in edit mode
        - best practices - write custom editor script to perform this update
            in edit mode
