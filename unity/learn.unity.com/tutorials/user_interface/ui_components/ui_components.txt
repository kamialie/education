1) UI Canvas
    > controls how group of ui elements will be rendered
    > all ui elements must be children of canvas
    > render modes:
        - screen space overlay - feels entiry screen automatically and is
            autoadjusted based on current screen (size setting are not available);
            Overlays everything on the screen
        - screen space camera - very similar to the previos one, lets specify
            specific camera that will render the canvas (specific setting can be
            appleid); most common - perspectic camera - to give ui a feeling of
            depth, canvas fills camera's viewport automatically
        - world space - renders ui elements in scene volume (could be static
            object in the scene or mobile labels following a player);
            event camera is required to receive events and determine which camera
            will be used to detect events like clicking (usually main camera);
    > canvas elemets are rendered in a top-down order
    > pixel perfect checkbox - ui elements will be adjusted to the nearest pixel,
        which can sharpen the look in some cases

2) Rect Transform
    > all UI elements have Rect Transform instead of usual transform of 3D objects
    > UI element is anchored to it's parents Rect Transform
    > editing
        - holding shift key will resize UI element proportionaly
        - near corners (outside) can rotate the element
        - rotations are done according to pivot point: click and drag blue
            circle in the middle (change to Pivot in Center/Pivot toggle)
    > anchor point is by default the middle of parent object; position is relative
        to that anchor point; anchors (four correspoding to four corners of
        a rectangle) are within the bounds of parent object; anchor min, max
        values are relative to parent's size and are absolute (normalized from
        0 to 1, 0,0 is lower left corner); distance from anchors to object's
        corners is fixed
        common cases of placement:
            - corners of an object - stretch will maintain and will take the
                same percentage area of the parent
            - corners of a parent - fixed border
            - particular side of a parent - stretching either horizonally, but
                not vertically or vice versa
            !- testing can be done while object is selected, parent comes back
                after transformations
        holding shift when positioning anchors will also change object's size
    > pivot point is in boundaries of object scaled for 0 to 1, 0 0 being lower
        left corner
    > resizing doesnt change items related to UI element (font size, etc);
        negative values makes element invisible
    > scaling effects all items of UI element, can also flip it round, when
        fiven negative values
    > blueprint mode - as if object wasnt rotated and scaled
    > raw edit mode - changing anchors, pivot point, etc also changes the object
