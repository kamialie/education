### Quoting

'\' preserves the meaning of the next character except newline - it is treated as a line continuation. Single quotes preserve the literal meaning of each character within the quotes, cant escape single quotes with single quotes. Double quotes do the same except for '$', '`', '\', '!'(when history expansion is enabled). Backslashes that are followed without special meaning are left unmodified. Parameters '*', '@' have special meaning in double quoates.

ANSI-C quoting take the form *\$\'string\'*, for example \t, \n, \octal_number_for_unicode_symbol, etc

Interactive comments are on by default.

----------

### Variables

To access variable use '**$**' in front:
* **0** - name of the schell or shell script
* **$** - ID of the shell
* **!** - ID of the last executed background process(job, pipeline)
* **?** - exit status of the last executed foreground pipeline
* **_** - expands to the last argument of last command executed

----------

### Shell commands

Simple shell commands consists of the commands itself followd by arguments, separeted by spaces

----------

### Pipelines

The format for a pipeline:
```bash
[time [-p]] [!] command1 [ | or |& command2] ...
```

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separeted by one of the control operators '**|**' or '**|&**'. The output of the each command is connected via a pipe to the input of the next command (connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command).

If '**|&**' is used, command's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to next command input (shorthand for 2>&1 |).

Reserved work *time* causes timing statistics to be printed for the pipeline once it finishes, the **-p** option changes the output to POSIX format.

Each command in a pipeline is executed in its own subshell, which is a separete process. The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command in the pipeline. If the reserved '**!**' precedes the pipeline, the exit status is the logical negation of the exit status.

----------

### Lists of commands

A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separeted by one of the operators (optionally terminated by '**;**', '**&**', or a newline):

		;, &, &&, ||

Of the list operators, '**&&**', '**||**' have equal precedence, followed by '**;**', '**&**', which have equal precedence.

If a command is terminated by a control operator '**&**', the shell executes the command asynchronously in a subshell (in the background). The shell doesnt wait for the command to finish and the return status is 0. Command separated by a '**;**' are executed sequentially.

AND example:
```bash
command1 && command2
```
Second command is executed of first one returns an exit status of zero (success).

OR example:
```bash
command1 || command2
```
Second command is executed of first one returns a non-zero exit status.

----------

### Compound commands


----------

### Looping constructs

'**;**' can be replaced by one or more newlines.

#### until
```bash
until test-commands; do consequent-commands; done
```
Execute consequent commands as long as test command has an exit status which is not zero. Return status is the return status of the last consequent command, or zero if none was executed.

#### while
```bash
while test-commands; do consequent-commands; done
```
Same as above.

### for
```bash
for name [ [in [words ...] ] ; ] do commands; done

for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr 3 )) ; do commands ; done
```

Expands *words* and execute *commands* once for each member in the resultant list.

### Conditional constructs

#### if
```bash
if test-command; then
    consequent-commands;
[elif more-test-commands; then
    more-consequent;]
[else alternate-consequents;]
fi
```
If clause evaluated when test-commands returns 0 (success status), otherwise elif, else clauses execute in turn.

#### case
```
case word in
    [ [(] pattern [| pattern]...) command-list ;;]...
esac
```
Case will selectively execute command-list to the first pattern that matches *word*. '**|**' is used to separate patterns, '**)**' - to terminate a pattern list.

Each clause (list of patterns and associated command-list) must be terminated with '**;;**', '**;&**', or '**;;&**'. Default case can be denoted with '\*' (common idiom).
* **;;** - no subsequent matches are attempted after first pattern match
* **;&** - causes execution to continue
* **;;&** - shell tests the next clause and executes it on succcessful match

### Fun stuff

* \<esc\> + . - insert last argument of previous command
